## **🛠 Models & Approach**  

### 🔹 **Isolation Forest**  
- Identifies anomalies by isolating points that deviate significantly from the overall distribution.  

### 🔹 **Autoencoder (Neural Network)**  
- Trains a model to **reconstruct normal price patterns** and flags deviations as anomalies.  

### 🔹 **Z-Score Method**  
- Detects anomalies based on **statistical deviations from the mean**.
